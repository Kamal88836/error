Got it 👍 Looks like Red Hat is asking you to confirm the server model, card models, and OpenShift version.

Since you’re working with OpenShift (and earlier you mentioned static infra), I’ll give you the exact commands to collect everything from the server.


---

✅ 1️⃣ Get Server Model (Hardware Model)

Run on the node (or via oc debug node → chroot /host):

dmidecode -s system-manufacturer
dmidecode -s system-product-name

Or full details:

dmidecode | grep -E "Manufacturer|Product Name|Serial Number"

If dmidecode not available:

cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name
cat /sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/sys_vendor


---

✅ 2️⃣ Get Network Card Model

List network adapters:

lspci | grep -i ethernet

For detailed info:

lspci -nn | grep -i ether

If you want driver info:

ethtool -i <interface-name>

Example:

ethtool -i ens192


---

✅ 3️⃣ Get Storage Controller Card Model

lspci | grep -i -E "raid|storage|sas|scsi"

If using HBA:

lspci -nn | grep -i sas


---

✅ 4️⃣ Get OpenShift Version

From bastion:

oc version

Or cluster version:

oc get clusterversion

If node-level:

cat /etc/os-release

For RHCOS version:

rpm-ostree status


---

🔥 If You Are Inside oc debug node

You must run:

chroot /host

Then execute all commands.

📋 Clean Way to Send to Red Hat

You can collect everything into one file:

(
echo "=== Server Model ==="
dmidecode -s system-manufacturer
dmidecode -s system-product-name

echo "=== Network Cards ==="
lspci | grep -i ethernet

echo "=== Storage Controllers ==="
lspci | grep -i -E "raid|storage|sas|scsi"

echo "=== OpenShift Version ==="
oc get clusterversion
) > server_details.txt


---

If you tell me:

Are you on control-plane or worker?

Baremetal or VMware?

Which OCP version (4.16 / 4.17 / 4.18)?


I can give you a more precise collection method 👌
